This real-life example uses a chunk of raw data selected from a survey conducted by RPS-MENA about the economic value of a public beach in Lebanon. The survey is done for NAHNOO a Lebanese NGO that fights for preserving public spaces and promotes sustainable urban design. The study is intended to serve as a tool to create strong arguments to mobilize, campaign, advocate and lobby decision makers to create the needed policies that would protect public beaches from privatization by showing their economic value.
